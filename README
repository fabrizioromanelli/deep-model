## Overview

deepModel is a Python object-oriented library built on top of Keras and TensorFlow for simplifying the creation and training of deep neural networks. It provides a user-friendly interface for designing, configuring, and training neural network models, making it easier for developers and researchers to work with deep learning.

## Features

- High-level API for defining neural network architectures.
- Modular and extensible design for easy customization.
- Integration with Keras and TensorFlow for efficient training and deployment.
- Support for a variety of neural network types, including feed-forward, convolutional, recurrent, and more.
- Built-in utilities for data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization.

## Installation

You can install your library using pip:

```bash
pip install deepModel
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use your library to create and train a basic feedforward neural network:

```python
from deepModel import RNN

# Define a neural network architecture
model = RNN()
model.add_input_layer(input_shape=(784,))
model.add_dense_layer(units=128, activation='relu')
model.add_dense_layer(units=10, activation='softmax')

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f'Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

For more detailed usage and examples, please refer to the documentation.
