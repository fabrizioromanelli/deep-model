## Version

The current version is 0.0.0.

## Overview

deepModel is a Python object-oriented library built on top of Keras and TensorFlow for simplifying the creation and training of deep neural networks. It provides a user-friendly interface for designing, configuring, and training neural network models, making it easier for developers and researchers to work with deep learning.

## Features

- High-level API for defining neural network architectures.
- Modular and extensible design for easy customization.
- Integration with Keras and TensorFlow for efficient training and deployment.
- Support for a variety of neural network types, including feed-forward, convolutional, recurrent, and more.
- Built-in utilities for data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization.

## Installation

You can install your library using pip:

```bash
pip install deepModel
```

This will install the library with full support for tensorflow-gpu.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use your library to create a Recurrent Neural Network:

```python
from deepModel import RNN

# Define a neural network architecture
model = RNN()
```

For more detailed usage and examples, please refer to the documentation.
